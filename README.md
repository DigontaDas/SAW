A Project that is inspired from the saw movie but the game is different than SAW. In this game as a player I have to answer questions that appears in the tv, If the player give the wrong answer he have to cut one of his limb or else the villian will kill him and gave will be over. If the player give right answer then one of the lock from the key box will open itself. The player have to do this 4 times and theres a timelimit to answer the questions. The game will end as successful if the player can get the key and open the door lock.
