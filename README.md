Conditions

If you answer wrong then you have to pay and it's gonna cost you a limb. So, if you love your limbs, answer carefully.
There is a time limit, if you don't answer or cut your limbs in time, then the saw villain will stab you. And the game overs.
If you cut four of your limbs the game overs anyways.
